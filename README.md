# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset

This report provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The dataset is a classic example used for binary classification tasks â€” predicting survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic shipwreck.

Key Components Covered in the Report:

Data Overview: Includes general information about the dataset such as number of rows and columns, data types, and missing values.

Statistical Summary: Provides a descriptive statistics table including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for numeric variables.

Missing Value Analysis: Highlights columns with missing data and the extent of these gaps.

Visualizations:

Bar plots and count plots showing survival distribution by gender, passenger class, and age groups.

Histograms and boxplots for age, fare, and other continuous variables.

Pie charts and stacked bars for categorical features like embarked locations.

Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlation between numerical variables to reveal linear relationships.

Feature-wise Insights: Analyzes how individual features (e.g., Sex, Pclass, Fare, Age) relate to survival probability.

Conclusion Section: Summarizes key findings and insights from the data exploration.
